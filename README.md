# AI-Snake-Game
The project centers around the artificial intelligence aspect of the Snake game. The objective of the snake is to consistently consume food and rapidly occupy the entire game board with its body. The game has been revamped in Python to offer an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) and facilitate straightforward algorithm implementations.
